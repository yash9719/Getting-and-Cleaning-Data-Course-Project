# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Files:
CodeBook.md describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analysis described in this 5 steps:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalTidyData.txt is the output of the final step
